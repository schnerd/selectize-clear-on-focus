# Selectize "Clear on Focus" Plugin

A quick plugin for [Selectize](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js) single-select elements.

When the drop-down is opened, the current value is cleared (and stored behind the scenes). If a new item is selected, the previous value is discarded. However if Selectize loses focus without a new item being selected, the previous value is restored.
